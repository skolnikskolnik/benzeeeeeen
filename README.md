## Description: 
This is an in-progress application for chemistry teachers, by chemistry teachers. As of right now it builds a database of weak acids and can use that database to generate theoretical titration curve data for weak acid/strong base titrations. More and more functionality will be added to benzeeeeeen to make this a one stop shop for chemsitry teachers looking to save time. 

Users can add, remove, and edit acids in the database:

Users then enter experiment conditions and use this to generate titration curve data:
